            <p>The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble
                mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in
                1631
                by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz
                Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
                (42-acre)
                complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides
                by a
                crenellated wall.</p>

            <p>The Charminar (lit. 'four minarets') is a monument located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed in
                1591, the landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana.[3]
                The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425
                years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy
                local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions
                in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid
                al-Fitr,[4] as it is adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.</p>

            <p>Humayun's tomb (Persian: Maqbara-i Humayun) is the tomb of Humayun in Delhi, India.[1] The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum under her patronage[2][3][4][5][6] in 1558, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad,[7] Persian architects chosen by her.[8][9] It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent,[10] and is located in Nizamuddin East, Delhi, India, close to the Dina-panah Citadel, also known as Purana Qila (Old Fort), that Humayun found in 1538. It was also the first structure to use red sandstone at such a scale.[11][12] The tomb was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993,[10] and since then has undergone extensive restoration work, which is complete</p>

        <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːl qiːlaː]) is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.</p>
